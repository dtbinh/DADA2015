\subsubsection{WP3 Authoring}

\paragraph{Task31: Specification of a dramatic language for virtual actors.}

This will include a choice of verbs (actions, speech acts, movements) and adverbs (moods, attitudes, dramatic effects) 
for directing actors ; define cues as synchronisation points between actors ; define parallel and sequential behaviors ; etc.

Part of this language will be devoted to stage blocking / movement

Part of this language will be devoted to dialogue


\paragraph{Task32: Authoring tools for blocking a scene with multiple actors.}

Design and implementation of authoring tools for creating animation with the dramatic language.

Previous work has focused on direct annotation of play-scripts with high-level (FML) or low-level (BML) mark-up.

From a user perspective, this is neither intuitive nor expressive. Instead, we will offer authoring tools
with natural interaction, taking inspiration from existing practices in theatre (prompt-books, cue sheet, storyboards, etc.).


The authoring tool may include multimodal interaction with the director: sketching tools for designing actor trajectories
and meeting points; writing tools for adding didascalia to dialogues; timeline-driven interaction for defining cue points
and actions, timing, etc.

User interface for directing actors by sketching stage floor plans and composing the dramatic score ; one line per actor per motion component (proxemic behaviors, kinesic actions, kinesic moods, speech acts, etc.)

Compilation of the language into a finite state machine and/or Petri net ; allowing real-time execution of the dramatic score.


\paragraph{Task33: Real-time execution of the dramatic score.} 

This should include real-time combination of proxemic (procedural) and kinesic components of motion ; non-deterministic motion generation ; synchronization to cues ; real-time skinning and advanced 3D animation ; integration of physically-based secondary animation (skin, hair, clothes, etc.)

This includes integration of the GRETA BML realizer with IMAGINE animation ; and real-time integration of the statistical models of motion with the procedural animation components.
