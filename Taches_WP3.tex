\paragraph{Task31} Specification of a dramatic language of verbs (actions, speech acts, movements) and adverbs (moods, attitudes, dramatic effects) for directing actors ; define cues as synchronisation points between actors ; define parallel and sequential behaviors ; etc.

Part of this language will be devoted to stage blocking / movement

Part of this language wil be devoted to dialogue

\paragraph{Task32}  Compilation of the language into a finite state machine and/or Petri net ; allowing real-time execution of the dramatic score ; user interface for directing actors by sketching stage floor plans and composing the dramatic score ; one line per actor per motion component (proxemic behaviors, kinesic actions, kinesic moods, speech acts, etc.)

\paragraph{Task33} Real-time execution of the dramatic score ; real-time combination of proxemic (procedural) and kinesic components of motion ; non-deterministic motion generation ; synchronization to cues ; real-time skinning and advanced 3D animation ; integration of physically-based secondary animation (skin, hair, clothes, etc.)

This includes integration of the GRETA BML realizer with IMAGINE animation ; and real-time integration of the statistical models of motion with the procedural animation components.
