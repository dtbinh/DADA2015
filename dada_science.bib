  abstract = {We propose the audio inpainting framework that recovers portions of
    audio data distorted due to impairments such as impulsive noise,
    clipping, and packet loss. In this framework, the distorted data
    are treated as missing and their location is assumed to be known.
    The signal is decomposed into overlapping time-domain frames and
    the restoration problem is then formulated as an inverse problem
    per audio frame. Sparse representation modeling is employed per frame,
    and each inverse problem is solved using the Orthogonal Matching
    Pursuit algorithm together with a discrete cosine or a Gabor dictionary.
    The Signal-to-Noise Ratio performance of this algorithm is shown
    to be comparable or better than state-of-the-art methods when blocks
    of samples of variable durations are missing. We also demonstrate
    that the size of the block of missing samples, rather than the overall
    number of missing samples, is a crucial parameter for high quality
    signal restoration. We further introduce a constrained Matching Pursuit
    approach for the special case of audio declipping that exploits the
    sign pattern of clipped audio samples and their maximal absolute
    value, as well as allowing the user to specify the maximum amplitude
    of the signal. This approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art
    and commercially available methods for audio declipping in terms
    of Signal-to-Noise Ratio.},
