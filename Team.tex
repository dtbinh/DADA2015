The consortium involves three research teams with complementary experience in computer graphics, intelligent virtual agents and statistical machine learning and a research team in theatre studies. LITC and LIF   are already working together on facial animation from speech through the co-supervision of Yu Ding's PHD thesis. Inria/Imagine and Paris 8 are also already working together on directing audiovisual prosody of actors, as part of Ad\'ela Barbulescu's PhD  thesis. Results of the two theses will be exploited in the project.

\paragraph{INRIA EPI IMAGINE}

IMAGINE is an INRIA research-project-team (EPI) of 6 permanent researchers created in 2012 by Marie-Paule Cani and R\'emi Ronfard in Grenoble.  IMAGINE stands for "Intuitive Modeling and Animation for Interactive Graphics \& Narrative Environments". The research goal for the team is  the efficient, interactive creation of animated 3D content using both procedural methods, enabling the fast generation of high quality content, and intuitive control handles, enabling users to easily convey their intent and to progressively refine their result. In adddition to R\'emi Ronfard,  two  permanent  researchers and a post-doctoral student will actively participate to the DADA project.


%These models will be used within different interactive environments dedicated to specific applications. More precisely, we will apply our work to three main domains: shape modeling, motion synthesis and narrative design. In addition to addressing specific needs of digital artists, this research should in the long term, enable professionals and scientists to represent and interact with models of their objects of study, and educators to quickly express and convey their ideas.   Our international scientific partners include UC Berkeley, UBC, the University of  Toronto, McGill and ETHZ and Disney Research Zurich. 


{\bf Marie-Paule Cani} is a Professor of Computer Science at Grenoble University (Grenoble Institute of Technology \& Inria), currently invited professor for 2014-2015 at College de France on the "Informatics and Computational Sciences" chair. Her research interests cover both Shape Modelling and Computer Animation. She contributed over the years to a number of high level models for shapes and motion such as implicit surfaces, multi-resolution physically-based animation and hybrid representations for real-time natural scenes and animated characters - with a specific interest for skin, clothes and hair. Following a long lasting interest for virtual sculpture, she has been recently searching for more efficient ways to create static and animated 3D content such as combining sketch-based interfaces with procedural models expressing a priori knowledge. She received the Eurographics outstanding technical contributions award in 2011 and a silver medal from CNRS in 2012. % for some of this work.

%Marie-Paule Cani served in the program committees of all major conferences in Computer Graphics and was program chair a number of times. She served in the steering committees of SCA, SBIM and SMI, and in the editorial board of Graphical Models, IEEE TVCG and CGF. She is currently associate editor of ACM Transactions on Graphics. She served in the executive committee of ACM SIGGRAPH from 2007 to 2011, and represented Computer Graphics in the ACM Publication Board from 2011 to 2014. In France, she belongs to the executive board of the GDR IG (Informatique Graphique) and to the CA of the French chapter of Eurographics.
