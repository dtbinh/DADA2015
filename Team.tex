The consortium involves three research teams with complementary experience in computer graphics, intelligent virtual agents and statistical machine learning and a research team in theatre studies. LITC and LIF   are already working together on facial animation from speech through the co-supervision of Yu Ding's PHD thesis. Inria/Imagine and Paris 8 are also already working together on directing audiovisual prosody of actors, as part of Ad\'ela Barbulescu's PhD  thesis. Results of the two theses will be exploited in the project.

{\bf Remi Ronfard} will be the co-ordinator of the DADA project. He is a computer scientist with a 20 year experience in industry and academia in France, Canada and USA. He has worked at the T.J. Watson IBM Research Center in New York as post-doc and as a visiting scientist (1992 and 2000).  He is now a member of the IMAGINE research team at Inria and the University of Grenoble, where his research is devoted to designing novel interfaces between artists and  computers. He is the author of 60 scientific papers published in top ranked international journals (IJCV, CVIU, PAMI) and conferences (Siggraph, Eurographics, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV)  and 4 international patents.  He was trained as an engineer then PhD student at Mines Paris Tech. He  has conducted research projects in digital storyboarding (INA, 1995), aesthetic surface design (IBM Research and Dassault Syst\'emes, 2000), video indexing (INA, 2000) and statistical analysis of film styles (INRIA 2002-2007). He was an expert in the international MPEG group from 1997 to 2000. In 2007, he  was an R \& D director  at Xtranormal Technologies, where his  team created the patented Magicam system, which was used to produce two million user-generated 3D animation movies. He  helped to create the IMAGINE team in 2012,  where he investigates innovative applications of computer graphics and computer vision to  visual storytelling. This has led to inspiring collaborations with the national  film school (ENS Louis Lumi\'ere) and the C\''elestins Theatre in Lyon. He  has  co-chaired international workshops on modeling people and human interaction (Beijing, 2005), 3-D cinematography (New York City, 2006; Banff, 2008; Providence, 2012) and intelligent cinematography and editing (Quebec, 2014; Zurich, 2015). He is currently serving as head of the Geometry and Image Department at Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann, Univ.  Grenoble Alpes.

\paragraph{INRIA EPI IMAGINE}

IMAGINE stand for: "Intuitive Modeling and Animation for Interactive Graphics \& Narrative Environments". The challenge we aim to address is the efficient, interactive creation of animated 3D content. To this end, our goal is to develop a new generation of knowledge-based models for shapes, motions and stories. These models will embed both procedural methods, enabling the fast generation of high quality content, and intuitive control handles, enabling users to easily convey their intent and to progressively refine their result. These models will be used within different interactive environments dedicated to specific applications. More precisely, we will apply our work to three main domains: shape modeling, motion synthesis and narrative design. In addition to addressing specific needs of digital artists, this research should in the long term, enable professionals and scientists to represent and interact with models of their objects of study, and educators to quickly express and convey their ideas.  
Our international scientific partners include UC Berkeley, UBC, the University of  Toronto, McGill and ETHZ and Disney Research Zurich. 

In adddition to Remi Ronfard, two other permanent  researchers and a post-doctoral student will actively participate to the DADA project.

{\bf Marie-Paule Cani} is a Professor of Computer Science at Grenoble University (Grenoble Institute of Technology \& Inria), currently invited professor for 2014-2015 at College de France on the "Informatics and Computational Sciences" chair. Her research interests cover both Shape Modelling and Computer Animation. She contributed over the years to a number of high level models for shapes and motion such as implicit surfaces, multi-resolution physically-based animation and hybrid representations for real-time natural scenes and animated characters - with a specific interest for skin, clothes and hair. Following a long lasting interest for virtual sculpture, she has been recently searching for more efficient ways to create static and animated 3D content such as combining sketch-based interfaces with procedural models expressing a priori knowledge. She received the Eurographics outstanding technical contributions award in 2011 and a silver medal from CNRS in 2012 for some of this work.

Marie-Paule Cani served in the program committees of all major conferences in Computer Graphics and was program chair a number of times. She served in the steering committees of SCA, SBIM and SMI, and in the editorial board of Graphical Models, IEEE TVCG and CGF. She is currently associate editor of ACM Transactions on Graphics. She served in the executive committee of ACM SIGGRAPH from 2007 to 2011, and represented Computer Graphics in the ACM Publication Board from 2011 to 2014. In France, she belongs to the executive board of the GDR IG (Informatique Graphique) and to the CA of the French chapter of Eurographics. She has been Vice President of Eurographics since January 2013.
