\subsubsection{WP0. Coordination} 

Four one-day meetings per year -> 14 meetings, including kick-off meeting and final review meeting. 

Collegical decision making:  A steering committee composed of Thierry Artières, Georges Gagneré, Catherine Pelachaud  and Rémi Ronfard will make all important decisions  in unanimity. In cases of disagreements, a compromise will have to be found. The committee will meet before every consortium meeting and its decisions will be communicated to all consortium members and to ANR.

Software development will be coordinated by Inria and Paris 8 using rapid prototyping methods.
All PHD Students will be asked to contribute their latest results to be included in the DADA prototype
at least twice a year (two months each). The rest of their time will be devoted to their research work.
References on rapid prototyping would be useful. 

Source code files will be signed by all contributing authors, together with their affiliations, to properly 
track intellectual property rights.
